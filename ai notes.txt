If an opponent cannot defend: You get to remove more cards. How good is that? (average?) (recursive?)

How good is a card?
	How easily will I be able to get rid of this card?
		Probability it can defend a card my opponent would play
		Probability I can play it on an attack: pairs have this halved, triples have this 1/3
	Will it allow me to get rid of more cards?
		Probability it wins the attack

Should I attack with these cards?
	Will my opponent be able to defend?
		Answer: Probability he can defend each card.
			Probability to defend each card = # cards that can defend it. Which of those have been discarded or in your hand. # cards in opponent hand
	Will the cards be replaced with better cards?
		Answer: If last card, then check easily
		Answer: Average card in deck

Should I defend?
	How bad are the cards I would pick up?
		Answer: (negative) How good are they
	How good are the cards I defend with?
	How likely is there to be more cards added on with the cards I defend?
		Likelyhood each card is in opponents hand
